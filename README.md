This is my capstone project for Code Louisville, the project is a portfolio for myself and currently includes the following required features:

**NOTE: The contact form DOES NOT submit anywhere, there is only JS validation on the form itself

    A typing and deleting effect that can be viewed on the home page made from Javascript

    Media Queries to move content when the page is resized from smaller to larger screens

    Javascript validation on the form under "contact me"

    CSS Hamburger Menu that can be see on screens smaller than 768px

    Javascript Image Carousel on the about me page that rotates through four random images

    There are no special requirements or parameters to run or view this project in its current state
